# Source Code
This branch contains the ***library used*** and the **source code** written by me in C. <br>
The libarary used (WinBGIm) is not a standard C library and is written for ***Microsft Windows Operating System ONLY***.
<br><br>

Ports of BGI for other Operating Systems are availableas as well. So, if your OS is not Windows and you want to run the BFS-visual program then you will have to find the port of BGI for your OS (from internet) and compile the source file and you are done.
<br><br>

BGI, is a graphics library for the DOS operating systems. WinBGIm (Windows BGI - with mouse) is a port of BGI for Microsoft Windows; it also provides several extensions.
It is a not  a standard library of C so, this library is not cross-platform!
<br>

The folder named [WinBGIm_Library6_0_Nov2005](https://github.com/jatin-47/BFS-Visual/tree/main/WinBGIm_Library6_0_Nov2005) contains the library files. "libbgi.a" is the library file and "graphics.h" is the header file which contains all the declarations and other stuff available with the library. <br><br>

***This library is very old (2005) but still useful when your task in hand is just to draw some easy graphics.*** ***BGI is less powerful than modern graphics libraries such as SDL or OpenGL, since it was designed for presentation graphics instead of event-based 3D applications. However, it has been considered simpler to code.***

<br><br><br>
*A ***port*** is a term used to describe the process of taking a program that has been written for specific operating systems and moving it to another operating system so it can be run there.*
